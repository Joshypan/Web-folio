            <p> 
                Hello! I am Joshua Panchana Cede√±o, a Computer Science student at the University of Akron. In addition to pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I am also pursuing two minor
                in Applied Mathematics and one in Spanish. My current cummulative GPA is a 3.4. <br/><br/>

                At the University of Akron, I am heavily invovled on campus. During my second year in college, I was the President 
                of UA Latinos and a general member of Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). UA Latinos is an orangization that aimed to connect and support the Latino and Hispanic population on campus. As President, I strived to grow the number of 
                members in the orangization and make the club standout, to let others aware of our presence! After two successful years, I am proud to say that the membership
                count has tripled from 10 to 30. In addition it has been awarded a Life Award for Diversity in 2023. Afterwards, in my fourth year (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024), I was appointed as Vice President
                of the SHPE. SHPE is an orangization that aids its' members in their professional development. We collaborate with other engineering societies on campus and collaborate
                with local companies such as Goodyear, Marathon, Nestle, and Lubrizol (to name a few). During the spring semester, I became a member of the Akronauts, the rocket design
                team on campus. I would help with the development on their graphic user interface for the test stands' components.

                Outside of education and my professional work, I tend to practice what I learn into my own project to apply what I have learned and to review. This site
                is a result of that.<br/><br/>

                Thank you for visiting!
