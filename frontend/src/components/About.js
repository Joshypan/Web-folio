            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Akron. In addition to pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I am also pursuing
             a minor in Applied Mathematics and Spanish. During my years at Akron, I have had two internship rotations at Goodyear Rubber and Tire Company.
             In the recent rotations, I created unit test in python to test functions prior to it being used by AWS services.
             Outside of education and my professional work, I tend to practice what I learn into my own project to apply what I have learned and to review. This site
             is a result of that as I am interested in web development and programming.

             I have experience in JavaScript, React, C++, AWS Lamdas, SQL, and Python. I have worked with Github, Github actions, Docker, Git, Jira, and Azure DevOps. 
             I am also educated in modern DevOps operations and am familiar with Agile methodologies. Refer to my Projects{Projects} page for more.

             Seeking: I am currently seeking a full-time position in software development or a related field. I am open to relocation and remote work opportunities.

             <h2>Background:</h2>
                I was born in Brooklyn, New York. Both of my parents are from Ecuador. I am bi lingual
